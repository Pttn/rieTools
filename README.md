# rieTools

rieTools is a collection of one-source-file tools related to the Riecoin project. Its purpose is mainly personal, to help me do some testing or better understand some concepts. Or simply for convenience. But who knows if they could be useful to other people (not necessarily related to Riecoin), so I make them public.

## Current tools

* constellationsGen: generate prime constellations of a given type, can use wheel factorization;
* constellationCheck: simple tool to check if a number is the base prime of a prime constellation;
* keysGen: generates Riecoin addresses with the private and public keys;
* blockHeaderDecode: decodes a given Riecoin block header and tell if the numbers of its 6-tuple are primes.

They can be compiled using a single line of code, given in the corresponding source code.
